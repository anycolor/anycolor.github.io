## "Take Me Down"


Take me down to the underground

带我到暗处吧

Won't you take me down, to the underground?

你会把我带到暗处吧？

Why oh why there is no light?

为何呢，这儿没有光？

And if I can't sleep, can you hold my life?

睡不着的我，你能帮忙保管一下吗？

And I,

唉

and all I see is you

我看到的都是你

And take my hand, I lost where I began

握我的手吧，我不知不觉走到了很远

In my heart I know all of my faults will you help me understand?

我心知自己的一切错误，你能帮我认清吗？

And I believe in you you're the other half of me

我相信你，你是我生命另一半

Soothe and heal when you sleep, when you dream

当你睡去，在梦里，安抚，治愈

I'll be there if you need me, whenever I hear you sing

无论何时听到你唱，你需要我就会在旁

There is a sun

这儿有个太阳

It'll come, the sun

这个太阳，就会出来的

I hear them call me down

我听到他们叫我下去了

I held you once, a love that once

我抱过你一次，爱过你一次

Life had just begun and you're all I see

生活刚刚开始，你是我最珍贵的

And trumpets blew, and Angels flew on the other side dear

对面的小号吹着，天使飞过，宝贝

And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need

你是我眼中的所有，你是我最想要的人

There's a love that God puts in your heart

上帝把一份爱放进你心里了
